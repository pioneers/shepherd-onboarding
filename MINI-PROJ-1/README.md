# Mini Project 1

In this first mini project you will be creating a flask application. 
Feel free to refer to the [HTML/CSS Tutorial](https://ritzy-acrylic-cd6.notion.site/Hyperlinks-Web-Dev-Tutorial-9bfd70a08412410b8c01b0e0b4721330) notebook for help.

If you have not already followed the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/pioneers/shepherd-onboarding/blob/solution-su2021/README.md) do so.
But if you still refuse to follow the [README.md](https://github.com/pioneers/shepherd-onboarding/blob/solution-su2021/README.md) all you will need to do is run 
```
pip3 install flask
```

## Parts to implement

### views.py
Fill in the code here. I suggest to first create the boiler plate code in `your_code.html` and putting a simple "hello world" in it. This is such that you can check the correctness of you work for `views.py`

To run `views.py`, in the `student` directory run
```
python3 views.py
```
and click the link provided in the terminal output. It should be `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

This should open a page in your browser.

### your_code.html
Create a brief intro page here for yourself. Feel free to share whatever you want about yourself but be sure to include the following:
- some sort of styling that is added through `styling.css`
- an interactive html element (example whould be a button that when clicked changes something in the window or console)

### styling.css
Create the styling for your elements.
### function.js
Create the javascript that will make your page interactive.
